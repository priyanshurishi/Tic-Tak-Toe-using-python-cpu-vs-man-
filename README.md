Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a best time killer paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking 
the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

This is a simulation between Cpu-vs-man.
